The folder Reverse_Engineering_BC_GRNs contains the major scripts and I/O files used to generate the results reported in the manuscript: "Unraveling the role of low-frequency mutated genes in breast cancer" (Lusito E., et al., 2018). The workflow is composed by the semi-automatic computational pipeline. Our future goal is to integrate all the single scripts in a fully automated R library.
